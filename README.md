1) sterilization_app.py
This is a simple app I created in python 3 that I came up with to solve a problem that used to occur in my old microbiology job. A huge issue in the lab was 
people sterilizing media and equipment at improper times and temperatures. The labware LIMS system we used would not inform you that you were sterilizing something
improperly. It was only under manual review later that it would be discovered things were sterilized incorrectly. This app asks the user to login, then asks what
container, volume, and number of containers they wish to sterilize and returns the correct sterilization info.

2) test_sqlite_app.py
Simple python app I created to test and show my sqlite skills. It creates a DB, create a table with dates and weights and then I find the average weight over the time entered.
