1) sterilization_app.py
This is a simple app I created in python 3 that I came up with to solve a problem that used to occur in my old microbiology job. A huge issue in the lab was 
people sterilizing media and equipment at improper times and temperatures. The labware LIMS system we used would not inform you that you were sterilizing something
improperly. It was only under manual review later that it would be discovered things were sterilized incorrectly. This app asks the user to login, then asks what
container, volume, and number of containers they wish to sterilize and returns the correct sterilization info.

2) test_sqlite_app.py
Simple python app I created to test and show my sqlite skills. It creates a DB, create a table with dates and weights and then I find the average weight over the time entered.

3) swift_lyrics_analyzer.py
This python script breaks down lyrics of all songs on Taylor Swift's new album and writes the count of each word to a CSV file for further analysis. You can plug in any txt file with words/strings and the script will still perform as intended as long as you change the input file name/location at the top of the script. Lyrics were copy and pasted from the internet into a text file

4) metacritic_scraper.py
This script was written in Python. It is a BeautifulSoup web scraper for the website metacritic and grabs the top 100 Xbox One games and their ratings. The results are then exported to a CSV.
